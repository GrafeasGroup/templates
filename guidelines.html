    <h1 class="text-center">General Guidelines for Transcription</h1>
    <p>
        **NOTE: These templates have been tested using Reddit on PC and the official mobile app. They may not look the
        same across different platforms.**

        When transcribing, you'll need to use one of the
        [formats](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/wiki/guidelines#wiki_formats) which will have format
        specific rules. However, please keep the following rules also in mind as they apply to every format.

        **NAMES & MENTIONS**

        * Names are often censored for privacy reasons. If a name is censored, use the color the submitter used to
        censor the name instead, i.e. **Red**, **Blue**, **Pink**, etc. If there isn't a color use **User 1** or
        similar. If this is for messages, use colors or "Left" and "Right" or the initials provided in the image. If
        those options aren't available, you can use **Redacted** or [*Censored*]. Please **DO NOT** use bold with
        brackets like [**Censored**].

        * Check the destination sub's rules on [including personal information
        (PI).](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/wiki/personalinformation) Most **do not** allow it. Please
        check with the sub to be certain! Not all subs update Old Reddit anymore, so make sure you are checking their
        rules and sidebar on New Reddit, or go to `r/
        <subreddit>/about/rules` on old reddit.

            * Names of media (shows, artwork, etc.) should be in quotes, such as `Fred from "Scooby Doo"` or `Fred from
            'Scooby Doo'`

            **LINKS**

            * Links should be described like an image instead of typed out to avoid the Reddit spam filter. Like

            [*Link to BBC News*]

            **WHAT TO TRANSCRIBE**

            * If the date does not provide any relevant information do **not** include a date and time.

            * Do not start your description off with "Image description: description" or "Image description -
            description". Just start describing right away.

            * Do **not** include likes, loves, shares, etc or the number of comments, unless it is relevant to the
            context and/or content of the post.

            * If the text to be transcribed includes emojis, please copy and paste the emoji into your transcription; we
            suggest [emojipedia.org](http://emojipedia.org/).

            * If the text to be transcribed uses special Unicode characters (єχαмρℓє 1, ǝxɐɯdlǝ 2, ệẍäṃṗŀệ 3 etc.) or
            script in a different alphabet/language (eg. Mandarin/Kanji) then please be aware that some screen readers
            do not process them accurately. If they are included literally, they should also be described.

            **STYLING**

            * For each subsequent reply in a reply chain, **increase the number of >s on the side by one.** This will
            continue nesting the comments to indicate that each is a reply to the one above it. If the comments are each
            replying to the post but not each other, this is unnecessary.

            * Do not include a horizontal rule between a post and its comments.

            * When text is on another line due to text wrapping (not enough space to show it on the same line due to the
            image), keep typing it on the same line instead of making a new line.

            * Please ensure that any text in the picture is transcribed verbatim rather than just being paraphrased.

            * When transcribing humor, transcribe the picture so that the heart of the joke remains the same, so that
            the transcription would be as funny to read as the image of the meme or comic.

            * When multiple paragraphs of a transcription are consecutive and indented with the same number of >, there
            should also be a > on the empty line between the paragraphs.

            * When you are mixing in italics and bold in the same line, you **MUST** end each formatting before you
            begin the next one or it won't format on old Reddit, which some people use. This means that if you want to
            type out:

            [*This is a description* ***that is bold***]

            You must type it out as:

            [*This is a description* ***that is bold***]

            * You must use 2 enter spaces to make a new line on Reddit

            So you must type

            text

            text

            instead of

            text
            text

            * When text is stylized in a way that Reddit cannot handle (i.e. highlight, underline, hyperlinked), you can
            describe the beginning and end like:

            [*Circled in red*] Text [*End circled in red*]

            * When different post types are embedded in one another such as a Facebook post with an image of a Twitter
            post, you should use the format that matches the host site and describe the beginning and end of the embed
            while indenting the embed by one > on every level. For [this post](https://i.imgur.com/a68tvTI.jpg) the
            transcription should look like [this image](https://i.imgur.com/DBy7zYz.png)
