    <h1 class="text-center">General Guidelines for Transcription</h1>
    <p>
        When transcribing, you'll need to use one of the <a href="index.html">formats</a> which will have
        format-specific rules. However, please keep the following rules also in mind as they apply to every format.
    </p>

    <h2>NAMES & MENTIONS</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Names are often censored for privacy reasons. If a name is censored, use the color the submitter used to
            censor the name instead, i.e. **Red**, **Blue**, **Pink**, etc. If there isn't a color use <strong>User
            1</strong> or similar. If this is for messages, use colors or "Left" and "Right" or the initials provided in
            the image. If those options aren't available, you can use <strong>Redacted</strong> or [<em>Censored</em>].
            Please <strong>DO NOT</strong> use bold with brackets like [<strong>Censored</strong>].
        </li>
        <li>
            Make sure that the community you're working with doesn't have any rules on sharing personal information.
            For example, on Reddit, many subreddits <strong>do not</strong> allow any kind of personal information
            (like names or profile pictures) to be shown. Ensure you're following the expectations of the community
            as best you can.
        </li>
        <li>
            Names of media (shows, artwork, etc.) should be in quotes, such as <code>Fred from "Scooby Doo"</code> or
            <code>Fred from 'Scooby Doo'</code>.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>LINKS</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Links should be described like an image instead of typed out to avoid spam filters. For example:
            [<em>Link to BBC News</em>]
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>WHAT TO TRANSCRIBE</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            If the date does not provide any relevant information do <strong>not</strong> include a date and time.
        </li>
        <li>
            Do not start your description off with "Image description: description" or "Image description -
            description". Just start describing right away.
        </li>
        <li>
            Do <strong>not</strong> include likes, loves, shares, etc. or the number of comments, unless it is relevant
            to the
            context and/or content of the post.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the text to be transcribed includes emojis, please copy and paste the emoji into your transcription; we
            suggest <a href="http://emojipedia.org/" target="_blank">emojipedia.org</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the text to be transcribed uses special Unicode characters (єχαмρℓє 1, ǝxɐɯdlǝ 2, ệẍäṃṗŀệ 3 etc.) or
            script in a different alphabet/language (eg. Mandarin/Kanji) then please be aware that some screen readers
            do not process them accurately. If they are included literally, they should also be described.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>STYLING</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            For each subsequent reply in a reply chain, <strong>increase the number of >s on the side by one.</strong>
            This will continue nesting the comments to indicate that each is a reply to the one above it. If the
            comments are each replying to the post but not each other, this is unnecessary.
        </li>
        <li>
            Do not include a horizontal rule between a post and its comments.
        </li>
        <li>
            When text is on another line due to text wrapping (not enough space to show it on the same line due to the
            image), keep typing it on the same line instead of making a new line.
        </li>
        <li>
            Please ensure that any text in the picture is transcribed verbatim rather than just being paraphrased.
        </li>
        <li>
            When transcribing humor, transcribe the picture in a way that the heart of the joke remains the same, so
            that the transcription would be as funny to read as the image of the meme or comic.
        </li>
        <li>
            When multiple paragraphs of a transcription are consecutive and indented with the same number of >, there
            should also be a > on the empty line between the paragraphs.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                When you are mixing in italics and bold in the same line, you <strong>MUST</strong> end each formatting
                before you begin the next one or it won't format on old Reddit. This also may be an issue on other
                platforms. This means that if you want to type out:
            </p>
            <p>
                [<em>This is a description <strong>that is bold</strong></em>]
            </p>
            <p>
                You must type it out as:
            </p>
            <code>[*This is a description* ***that is bold***]</code>
        </li>
        <li>
            In markdown, you must type two spaces at the end of a sentence to make a new line. If you want a paragraph
            break, you will need to put an extra empty line between your sections. For example, you type:
            <p>
            <pre>
                    text
                    text
                </pre>
            ...will render to <code>text text</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using <code>•</code> as our example space character, you would need to type:
            <pre>
                    text••
                    text
                </pre>
            ...to get:
            <code>
                text
                text
            </code>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            When text is stylized in a way that your chosen platform cannot handle (i.e. highlight, underline,
            hyperlinked), you can describe the beginning and end like:
            <pre>
                [*Circled in red*] Text [*End circled in red*]
            </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            When different post types are embedded in one another such as a Facebook post with an image of a Twitter
            post, you should use the format that matches the host site and describe the beginning and end of the embed
            while indenting the embed by one > on every level. For <a href="./images/guidelines_example1.jpg">
            this post</a>, the transcription should look like <a href="./images/guidelines_example2.jpg">this image</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>
