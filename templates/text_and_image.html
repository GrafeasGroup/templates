    Photo of a child wearing a backpack. The backpack is in the shape
    of a crewmate from 'Among Us' but has the color scheme of a Pok√©ball;
    the top is red and the bottom is white with a black strip horizontally
    through the middle. The middle part has a see-through sphere and inside
    is a real cat.
