        Please attempt to give a general idea of what the image is. Add as much detail
        as you feel is necessary, but be descriptive. Imagine describing it to someone
        who can't see the picture.

    <p><strong>NOTE: The template shows how to format the content, not which order you
        have to follow to transcribe a post!</strong> If you're not sure where to start,
        give a brief overview then consider what first drew your attention; that's
        probably a good place to start!

    Photo of a child wearing a backpack. The backpack is in the shape
    of a crewmate from 'Among Us' but has the color scheme of a Pok√©ball;
    the top is red and the bottom is white with a black strip horizontally
    through the middle. The middle part has a see-through sphere and inside
    is a real cat.
