            An (unofficial) bank of templates for transcribing common posts/memes can be found
            <a href="https://github.com/MurdoMaclachlan/ToR-Repost-Collection/wiki">here</a>.
            As any Reddit user knows, we love to rehash old jokes, beat dead horses, and
            generally go around in circles - now we have a collection of templates for those
            reposts to make your lives even easier! Feel free to add new templates, but make sure
            they follow the right guidelines. Feel free to ask a mod or the Discord for help, and
            someone will be able to sort you out!
