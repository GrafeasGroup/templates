            Most Quora posts have a username, location, and a status. If they don't, leave them out. If they are blurred out,
            replace them with [Redacted] or [Unknown]
        </li>
        <li>
            Dates can be left out unless they are relevant to the context of the post.
        </li>
        <li>
            Treat responses to questions like post replies, and add a level of indentation.

        alt="Screenshot of a Quora question and answer. The question is 'When I was 4, my sister was 2. I am 44. How old is my sister?'. It
        was answered by someone called Samuel Lipoff who studied at Harvard University, according to their Quora status. Their answer to
        the question is 'This is a tough one. She might be 42, but she could be 41 or 43 also, since you don't say when your birthday is and her
        birthday is. Also, she could be dead. Finally, you might have thought she was your sister but actually your mom had an
        affair with another man and the woman who is 1-3 younger than you is not actually your sister. But your mom may have
        given away your real sister for adoption, in which case she's probably older than you. See why it's tough? Finally, what if you think your
        sister is dead, but she actually has become an astronaut on a secret government project for near light-speed travel? Then your sister would
        be aging more slowly than you, so she could potentially be even younger than 41.'"
