    <p>
        Only transcribe karma points and awards if it's referenced or relevant to the post (for example, a person says
        "Wow, thanks for all the awards", or comment about the number of votes). If there are a lot of awards and you
        don't know what they are called, add the number of awards instead (ex. 5 Reddit awards, 2 gold, 1 silver or 8
        awards).
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If any details are missing, just state that it is <strong>Unknown Post/Redditor/Subreddit</strong>. You can
            also use the color of the redaction as the name if they are unique colors for each user.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Do not write u/Redacted, u/Username, etc. in your transcription</strong> – these are usernames of
            actual Redditors, and will cause your transcription to be automatically removed from certain subs that do
            not allow personal information. If usernames are redacted, "User 1/2/3" can be used as "names" in bold
            starting with the first redacted name.
        </li>
        <li>
            "User Reports" should go underneath whatever is being reported (directly under the post or directly under
            the comment if the comment was reported).
        </li>
        <li>
            When you have to write subreddit or user names in the body of the post or comment, place a backslash before
            the first forward slash in order to avoid mentioning or linking to the user or subreddit. For example:
            <pre>
                **\/r/TranscribersOfReddit**

                **\/u/username**
            </pre>
            <p>
                becomes
            </p>
            <code>
                /r/TranscribersOfReddit
                /u/username
            </code>
            <p>
                These will still show up as a link in New Reddit, but they will not ping the sub or user.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For comments, try to keep the comments nested the same way as the image shows. For each new nesting level, add
        another `>`. If usernames are visible in the post, make sure to replace `**User 1**` etc. with the user's
        username.
    </p>
