            The chevrons (<code>></code>) in greentext are actual chevrons, and not markdown versions to show a reply.
            They need to
            be escaped with a backslash: <code>\></code>
        </li>
        <li>
            If a post or comment is talking about "dubs" or "trips," this refers to the last few digits of the post
            number: two repeating numbers in a row are "dubs," and three are "trips."
        </li>
        <li>
            Only include the timestamp if it is relevant to the post.
        </li>
        <li>
            When writing the username and timestamp headers in Greentext threads, <strong>only</strong> include the date
            if either
            changes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Time is written in 24h style.
        </li>
        <li>
            Please format the date in whatever style/order is provided in the source content.
        </li>
        <li>
            Greentext timestamps are given in hh:mm:ss, but unless two posts are made in the same minute, <strong>do not
            include the second</strong>.
