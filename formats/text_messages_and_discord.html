            Often text messages and similar platforms show messages from different users on opposite sides of the screen,
            as in the first example. In these instances please use <code>></code> to distinguish the user that is on the
            right to make transcriptions easier to read.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>If your messages have text above an image, transcribe the text before describing the image.</strong> Transcribe the
            text and image in the order they appear.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the same texter sends multiple messages in a row, identify them each time to show that they are separate
            messages instead of 1 long paragraph.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you are doing <strong>Discord Messages</strong> please keep in mind that the username is on its own line.
        </li>
        <li>
            Names are often censored for privacy reasons. If a name is censored, use the color the submitter used to
            censor the name instead, i.e. Red, Blue, Pink, etc. If there isn't a color use User 1 or similar. If this
            is for messages, use colors or "Left" and "Right" or the initials provided in the image.
