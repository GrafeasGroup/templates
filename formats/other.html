        Images can come from anywhere, so if we don't have a specific format guide or if you're in doubt stick to a simple format - Header, image
        description (if any), text transcription, footer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whether it's Snapchat, Twitch, Omegle, Tumblr, Instagram or the next social media website that hasn't been invented yet - add the title at
        the top and take it from there, as neatly as possible. If you're uncertain, feel free to message the mods for guidance or advice, we're here to help!
