    <p>
        Most posts have likes or shares in the form of thumbs ups, two arrows, emojis, etc. Feel free to leave those out
        <strong>unless</strong> it's important to the clarity of the post. For example, if the text says something like
        "For every share I'll do [something]", it would be relevant to show how many times the post has been shared.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes it's hard to figure out what social media platform an image is of because of the graphical differences
        between app/desktop versions. If you are unsure, feel free to declare it as Image Transcription: Social Media.

    <h2>Useful Notes:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Names are usually censored for privacy reasons, so instead use the color the submitter used to censor the
            name. i.e. <strong>Red</strong>, <strong>Blue</strong>, <strong>Pink</strong>, etc. For multiple users
            censored with the same colour, use <strong>User 1</strong>,<strong>User 2</strong>, etc. For a single user,
            you can also use <strong>Redacted</strong> or [<em>Redacted</em>] (or similar, by formatting the word
            "Censored"). Please DO NOT use bold with brackets like [<strong>Censored</strong>].
        </li>
        <li>Check with the place you're transcribing for rules about personal information! Most <strong>do not</strong>
            allow it. Please check to be certain!
        </li>
        <li>Do <strong>not</strong> include dates or times unless these are required for the context of the content.
        </li>
        <li>Do <strong>not</strong> include Retweets, Shares, Likes, etc, unless it is truly relevant to the context
            and/or content of the post.
        </li>
        <li>Make sure to tell the difference between standalone posts and replies to posts. If a post includes an
            original tweet and a reply, use block quote <code>&gt;</code> for the reply.
        </li>
        <li>If the text to be transcribed includes emojis, please copy and paste the emoji into your transcription; we
            suggest <a href="http://emojipedia.org/" target="_blank">emojipedia.org</a>. Do not describe the emoji,
            unless it is a
            custom emoji.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to spot a Facebook post</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            If a post has text over a coloured background or something with emojis.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the username says something like <code>[<em>Redacted</em>] is with you and 12 others.</code>
        </li>
        <li>
            If the username says something like <code>[<em>Redacted</em>] is feeling anxious/lonely/happy/ watching
            Star Wars.</code>
        </li>
    </ol>
