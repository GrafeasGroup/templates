            Write the text and describe the scene in the rough order that it is intended to be seen. For example, if there is text at the top of
            the panel, then a scene in the center, then more text at the bottom of the panel, write it as such.

        is actually a half-dismantled tower of Jenga blocks, with some blocks sitting haphazardly on the grey table underneath. The blue character

        a new Jenga block labeled 'Feature' to the tower. This action is labeled 'Pushes'."
