    <ul>
        <li>
            Some Tumblr posts may be posted with the old-style layout, <a
                href="../images/tumblr_old_format_example.jpeg">appearing like this</a>, and for these posts the
            standard format should still be used. Just remember that a new reply on the left means a new separator and
            username before writing out the reply.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sometimes Tumblr will contain screenshots that appear as message bubbles, <a
                href="../images/tumblr_message_bubbles_example.png">looking like this</a>. This is <em>not</em> an
            "ask"; instead, please follow our <a href="../guidelines.html">guidelines on embedding</a> and simply embed
            the content like another Tumblr post inside, by calling it a screenshot of a post reply.
        </li>
        <li>
            Do <strong>not</strong> include the <code><strong>User 1</strong> reblogged from <strong>User
            2</strong></code> line unless it is relevant to the post.
        </li>
        <li>
            Always add hashtags in the post, as they help to provide context. Just remember to escape the \# when
            writing in markdown, or they will show up as headers instead.
        </li>
